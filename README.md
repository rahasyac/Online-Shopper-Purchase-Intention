# Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention
Analyzing and exploring the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset Data Set


# Description

The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions.The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period. The dataset contains information about the number 
of different types of pages visited by the visitor in that session and total time spent in each of these page categories. The values of these 
features are derived from the URL information of the pages visited by the user and updated in real time when a user takes an action, e.g. moving from one page to another. The "Bounce Rate", "Exit Rate" and "Page Value" features represent the metrics measured by "Google Analytics" for each page in the e-commerce site. The "Special Day" feature indicates the closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day (e.g. Motherâ€™s Day, Valentine's Day) in which the sessions are more likely to be finalized with transaction.The dataset also includes operating system, browser, region, traffic type, visitor type as returning or new visitor, a Boolean value indicating whether the date of the visit is weekend, and month of the year.
